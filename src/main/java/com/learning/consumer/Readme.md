The consumer interface of the functional interface is the one that accepts only one argument or a gentrified argument. 
The consumer interface has no return value. It returns nothing. 
There are also functional variants of the Consumer â€” DoubleConsumer, IntConsumer, and LongConsumer.
These variants accept primitive values as arguments.
